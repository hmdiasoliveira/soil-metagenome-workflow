Workflow for high-quality genome assembly and differential abundance analysis 
from Oxford Nanopore soil metagenomic data.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete bioinformatic pipeline used in:

> Wu, H. (2025). Long-Read Soil Metagenomic Assembly and Differential 
> Abundance Analysis Across Plant Shoot Biomass Gradients. *Master's Thesis*, 
> Australian National University.

## Data Availability

All raw sequencing data from this study are publicly available through NCBI:

**🔗 [NCBI BioProject PRJNA1400213](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1400213)**

- **358 BioSamples** across three experimental datasets
- **193 Gbp** of Oxford Nanopore R10 sequencing data
- Quality-filtered reads (≥300 bp, mean Q≥15)
- Comprehensive sample metadata included

### Datasets

The BioProject encompasses three complementary experiments:

1. **Boorowa agricultural soil time series** — Depth-stratified soil cores (surface and subsurface) sampled in 2019 and 2023, with paired soil chemistry data
2. **Plant productivity gradient** - Rhizosphere microbiomes across shoot biomass gradients in multiple crop hosts
3. **Forest vs. river soil comparison** - ACT soils under different fertilizer treatments

### Key Features

- **High-contiguity assembly** using metaMDBG optimised for ONT R10 chemistry
- **Rigorous contamination removal** through competitive mapping against host references
- **Compositionally-aware analysis** — GBM zero imputation and centred log-ratio transformation for sparse count data
- **Empirical FDR-controlled** differential abundance testing
- **Genome-resolved ecological interpretation** linking taxa to functional traits

## Key Results

- **556,967 contigs** totaling 7.69 Gbp
- **86 contigs >1 Mb** (longest: 4.52 Mb)
- **923 circular replicons** (complete genetic elements)
- **20% higher N50** vs. global SMAG catalogue
- **194 differentially abundant contigs** across biomass gradient
